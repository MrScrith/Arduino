# Arduino
This is a general pile of Arduino projects that I am working on, mostly dealing with the Lightblue Bean (https://punchthrough.com/bean/) which pairs an arduino with a bluetooth LE transmitter, it  exposes 8 inputs/outputs, a buit-in RGB LED, a temp sensor, and a three-axis accelerometer.

First project is the "camper light controller" (lightcontroller directory).
This is connected to a custom PCB that allows me to control a series of LED lights from several switches, eventually it will also expose controls to an IOS app using iBeacon funcitonality. This is going to be used to replace two really pitiful incandescent lights that draw 30+ watts with 5 LEDs that draw just a bit over 5 watts. Another LED light strip will be added to the outside of the camper for illuminating the entrance at night, but that is yet to be procured so I don't know the power consumption of it yet.
